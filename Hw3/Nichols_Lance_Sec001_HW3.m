%% Analysis and Write Up
% * (a) The experiment was completed using a ruler and my phone shooting at
% 25 fps The ruler wasn't in good focus aditionally paralax was not
% compencaded for and the computed veolocity could easily be introducing
% error.
% * (b) Done âœ“
% * (c) Air resistance was ignored because an analytical solution may not be
% avalible for that complex of a diff eq. The Effect is that solution is
% linear.
% * (d) I used 0.08 second step size as it is two frames at 25 fps.
% * (e) Not much signifigance can be shown between the perdicted outcomes.
% Although the "with drag" solution is falling a little slower after .5
% seconds because the faster it falls the more drag it gets.
% * (f) Linear solutions are much simpler but at high velocites wind
% resistance matters and should be accounted for
